```{r setup, include=FALSE}

modified_rates_idn <- function(res_mca_idn_2) {
  
  Q <- ncol(res_mca_idn_2$call$X)
  
  seuil <- 1/Q
  
  e <- data.frame(res_mca_idn_2$eig)[[1]][data.frame(res_mca_idn_2$eig)[[1]] >= seuil]
  
  pseudo <- (Q/(Q - 1) * (e - seuil))^2
  
  mrate <- round(pseudo/sum(pseudo) * 100, 2)
  
  cum_mrate <- cumsum(mrate)

  tibble(mod_rates = mrate, cum_mod_rates = cum_mrate)
}
```

## Load Data

```{r import-data}
# We load a whole MCA result object.
# The best thing to do is to load your own analysis results here!
res_mca <- read_rds("Data/mca-result.rds")
res_mca_idn_2 <- read_rds("Data/res_mca_idn_2.rds")
```

## Check eigenvalues

We'll just see if everything went well and what the quality of our results is like.

```{r mca-eigen}
fviz_eig(res_mca_idn_2)
modified_rates_idn(res_mca_idn_2)
```

## Start interpretation per axis

Well, we've already done this roughly and I'm sure you've improved on that. 
This is about interpreting the results of the MCA. The best way is axis by axis.

## Let's go where no man has gone before (almost)

```{r mcacaintegration}
## Apply Hierarchical Cluster Analysis on the results of our MCA.
res_hcpc <- HCPC(res_mca_idn_2)
```

We have actually arrived at the 2.5th dimension!

```{r mca-ca-integration}
## Apply Hierarchical Cluster Analysis on the results of our MCA.

plot(res_hcpc, choice = "3D.map")
```

But what does this map tell us?

I took the data of Indonesia from last assignment of MCA. The result of Axis 1 was pretty much of possessing/not possessing mobile phone or game devices, therefore, I assumed that there will be two large clusters. However, the optimized model by hierarchical clustering showed three clusters. The result when I cut the hierarchical analysis with three clusters has been compared with the MCA from last assignment, I suppose that the key characteristic which is contributing for cluster 1 is NOT possessing game equipment/mobile phone, for cluster 2 is the students who
are NOT agreeing a lot for variables of "Safe school", "Teacher explains good", "Like math/science", which means the students not being in a very good environment for studying . For cluster 3, it can be seen that the students who possess game devices and mobile phones.
